# Machine Learning with Keras API â€“ Practice Repository

This repository contains machine learning projects developed using the Keras API, following the guidance of [this YouTube course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFJeN9V1ZsI).  
The project consists of **two Python Notebook** files and a **`data/`** folder containing the datasets used in the applications.

## Contents

### Part_1_tf_keras.ipynb
This section covers practical implementations on data preprocessing, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).  
The work includes steps such as preprocessing data, creating and training an ANN, building a validation set, making predictions, generating a confusion matrix, and saving/loading models.  
Additionally, it covers preparing images for CNNs, training a CNN model, making predictions, and improving the model through **fine-tuning**.

### Part_2_tf_keras.ipynb
This section focuses on **image classification with MobileNet**, **fine-tuning** on a custom dataset, and **data augmentation** techniques.  
It also includes image preprocessing and transfer learning methods to improve model performance.
